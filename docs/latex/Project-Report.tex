\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
The field of Network-on-Chip (NoC) design has emerged as a critical area in modern computing systems, particularly in addressing the challenges of interconnect scalability and performance. This mini project focuses on the application of simulation and modeling techniques in optimizing Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) ring topology networks. Through comprehensive simulation modeling, we analyze and enhance network performance by addressing two critical challenges: temperature management and congestion control.

\subsection{Importance}
In the realm of software engineering, simulation and modeling serve as indispensable tools, especially when dealing with complex systems like ONoC networks. Traditional hardware testing approaches often prove costly and time-consuming, making simulation-based analysis an attractive alternative. Our project demonstrates the practical application of simulation techniques in several key areas.

The primary advantage lies in the ability to predict and optimize network performance before physical implementation. This predictive capability allows designers to identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate different routing algorithms under various operating conditions. Furthermore, simulation provides a controlled environment for validating design decisions through quantitative analysis, significantly reducing the risk and cost associated with hardware prototyping.

\subsection{Objectives and Scope}
This project encompasses several key objectives aimed at advancing our understanding of ONoC systems through simulation. Our primary goal is to develop a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model for ONoC ring topology networks. This model serves as a foundation for implementing and validating congestion-aware routing algorithms, enabling detailed analysis of system performance under various traffic scenarios.

The scope of our work extends beyond basic simulation to include temperature-aware routing optimization, congestion management, and performance analysis. We focus specifically on ring topology networks, considering both static and dynamic aspects of network operation. The project incorporates multiple performance metrics, including throughput, latency, temperature distribution, and congestion levels.

\section{Problem Definition}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Network traffic congestion in ONoC systems presents a significant challenge in modern chip design. As data transmission requirements grow, the need for efficient routing strategies becomes increasingly critical. Our research addresses the fundamental problem of finding optimal paths for data transmission while simultaneously managing both congestion and temperature constraints. This dual-objective optimization problem requires careful consideration of multiple competing factors.

\subsection{Real-life Scenario}
In high-performance computing systems, ONoC serves as the backbone of inter-core communication. The practical implications of network congestion and thermal issues extend beyond simple performance metrics to affect system reliability and longevity. When network hotspots develop, they can lead to increased latency, reduced throughput, and potential hardware failures. These issues become particularly critical in data-intensive applications where consistent high-performance operation is essential.

\subsection{Assumptions and Constraints}
Our simulation model operates under several key assumptions and constraints that define its scope and applicability. The network topology is assumed to maintain a fixed number of nodes in a ring configuration, reflecting common practical implementations. We consider computational resource limitations and real-time optimization requirements as primary constraints in our design.

\section{Conceptual Model}
\subsection{Model Description}
The conceptual framework of our simulation represents the ONoC system as a sophisticated graph structure. In this model, nodes serve as routers within the network, while edges represent the communication links between them. Each node carries attributes related to its temperature state, and edges maintain information about congestion levels. This representation allows for detailed analysis of network behavior under various operating conditions.

\subsection{System Components}
The model incorporates several key components that work together to simulate network behavior:

\subsubsection{Network Parameters}
The fundamental parameters of our model include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Network size (N nodes)
    \item Partition size (P)
    \item Link capacity and bandwidth
    \item Temperature thresholds
    \item Congestion limits
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics}
We track several critical performance metrics throughout the simulation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Node temperature distribution
    \item Link congestion levels
    \item Path length optimization
    \item Network throughput and latency
    \item Energy efficiency
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Control Parameters}
The system behavior is governed by several control parameters:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Temperature weight (wt)
    \item Congestion weight (wc)
    \item Routing algorithm selection criteria
    \item Partition optimization parameters
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Collection and Input Analysis}
\subsection{Data Collection Methodology}
Our simulation relies on comprehensive data collection from multiple sources to ensure accurate modeling of network behavior. We employ a systematic approach to gather and analyze data related to network performance, thermal characteristics, and traffic patterns. The data collection process encompasses three main areas:

\subsubsection{Network Monitoring}
Network monitoring focuses on capturing real-time traffic patterns, congestion levels, and routing decisions. We implement continuous monitoring systems that track packet flow, buffer utilization, and link status across the network. This data provides insights into the dynamic behavior of the system under various load conditions.

\subsubsection{Temperature Measurements}
Temperature data collection involves monitoring thermal patterns across the chip surface. We employ thermal sensors to track temperature variations at node locations, considering both steady-state and transient thermal behavior. This information is crucial for understanding the relationship between network activity and thermal distribution.

\subsubsection{System Performance Logs}
Comprehensive system logs provide detailed information about:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Error rates and failure patterns
    \item Resource utilization metrics
    \item Performance bottlenecks

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
The collected data undergoes rigorous statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships. Our analysis reveals that temperature distributions typically follow a normal distribution with mean μ = 70°C and standard deviation σ = 10°C. Traffic patterns exhibit both periodic behavior and burst characteristics, with significant spatial correlation in congestion levels.

\section{Simulation Design}
