\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
The field of Network-on-Chip (NoC) design has emerged as a critical area in modern computing systems, particularly in addressing the challenges of interconnect scalability and performance. This mini project focuses on the application of simulation and modeling techniques in optimizing Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) ring topology networks. Through comprehensive simulation modeling, we analyze and enhance network performance by addressing two critical challenges: temperature management and congestion control.

\subsection{Importance}
In the realm of software engineering, simulation and modeling serve as indispensable tools, especially when dealing with complex systems like ONoC networks. Traditional hardware testing approaches often prove costly and time-consuming, making simulation-based analysis an attractive alternative. Our project demonstrates the practical application of simulation techniques in several key areas.

The primary advantage lies in the ability to predict and optimize network performance before physical implementation. This predictive capability allows designers to identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate different routing algorithms under various operating conditions. Furthermore, simulation provides a controlled environment for validating design decisions through quantitative analysis, significantly reducing the risk and cost associated with hardware prototyping.

\subsection{Objectives and Scope}
This project encompasses several key objectives aimed at advancing our understanding of ONoC systems through simulation. Our primary goal is to develop a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model for ONoC ring topology networks. This model serves as a foundation for implementing and validating congestion-aware routing algorithms, enabling detailed analysis of system performance under various traffic scenarios.

The scope of our work extends beyond basic simulation to include temperature-aware routing optimization, congestion management, and performance analysis. We focus specifically on ring topology networks, considering both static and dynamic aspects of network operation. The project incorporates multiple performance metrics, including throughput, latency, temperature distribution, and congestion levels.

\section{Problem Definition}
\subsection{Problem Statement}
Network traffic congestion in ONoC systems presents a significant challenge in modern chip design. As data transmission requirements grow, the need for efficient routing strategies becomes increasingly critical. Our research addresses the fundamental problem of finding optimal paths for data transmission while simultaneously managing both congestion and temperature constraints. This dual-objective optimization problem requires careful consideration of multiple competing factors.

\subsection{Real-life Scenario}
In high-performance computing systems, ONoC serves as the backbone of inter-core communication. The practical implications of network congestion and thermal issues extend beyond simple performance metrics to affect system reliability and longevity. When network hotspots develop, they can lead to increased latency, reduced throughput, and potential hardware failures. These issues become particularly critical in data-intensive applications where consistent high-performance operation is essential.

\subsection{Assumptions and Constraints}
Our simulation model operates under several key assumptions and constraints that define its scope and applicability. The network topology is assumed to maintain a fixed number of nodes in a ring configuration, reflecting common practical implementations. We consider computational resource limitations and real-time optimization requirements as primary constraints in our design.

\section{Conceptual Model}
\subsection{Model Description}
The conceptual framework of our simulation represents the ONoC system as a sophisticated graph structure. In this model, nodes serve as routers within the network, while edges represent the communication links between them. Each node carries attributes related to its temperature state, and edges maintain information about congestion levels. This representation allows for detailed analysis of network behavior under various operating conditions.
